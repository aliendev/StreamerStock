# Streamer Stock

In Streamer Stock, you are a "nerd" moving from one stream to another, buying and selling shares of streamers and games to earn as much as you can. Compete with other nerds and see if you can have the biggest bank or make your streamer the highest ranked.


## Player Experience
In a dashboard, like responsive web app, the player will buy and sell stock of their favorite streamers and games for the goal of having the highest score / bank account on the leader board. The players will also be competing to send their favorite streamer to the top of Streamer's leaderboard.

Watch your reports, keep track of what stocks you have, want, which streamers are making waves, on the come up, going on vacation, who is sick, and much more. The more you know about your favorite streamers and what they are playing, the better you can predict when to buy and sell your Streamer Stock.

## Gameplay overview
A game developed to increase engagement, viewership, and most importantly, make twitch channel points useful for the chat/watchers. Streamer Stock is loosely based on the old school game "DopeWars".

Users will authenticate on stock.aliendev.com with Twitch and create their user account. The account will keep track of their debt, progress, stock holdings, streamers they are following and subbed to, and a watch list for those they are interested in.

They can use their channel points from a streamer on twitch to purchase boosters in the game, take out loans, or force events.
